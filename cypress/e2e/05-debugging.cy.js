/*
  If you use Cypress for debugging, yo have the following options available:

  - console.log('This is a log.')
  Considering that Cypress can run in Chrome, you can use Devtools to check the console for debugging.

  - cy.log('This is a log.')
  Cypress logs are displayed in the Cypress "timeline" sidebar.

  - cy.task('log', 'This is a log.')
  This log will be displayed when you run Cypress in headless mode.
  The method is defined in /cypress.config.js
